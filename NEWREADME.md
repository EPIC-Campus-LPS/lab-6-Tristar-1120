# Hey There!

Sorry for the strange formatting on this project, I run a Ubuntu distro with VSCode, which as you can imagine, makes java projects pretty difficult to keep clean. However, you should still be able to run the project without any issues. I've already compiled the files into classes, and just need to be run from the java directory. Sorry again!
